# Author Summary
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have transformed cancer therapy, yet their benefit varies dramatically across tumor immune microenvironments (TIMEs). In the clinic, ICI is often combined with chemotherapy, and clinicians must decide not only whether to use ICI, but also how to schedule both agents over months of treatment. We develop a reusable dynamic optimization framework that takes any ordinary differential equation model of tumor–immune–therapy interactions as input, enforces clinically motivated dosing and toxicity constraints, and outputs optimal chemo–ICI regimens. Using a mechanistic model and four virtual patients representing hot, cold, and extremely cold TIMEs, we show that the framework automatically suppresses futile ICI dosing in immune deserts, while allocating aggressive combination therapy to highly ICI-responsive tumors.
