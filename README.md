# Dynamic-optimization-of-chemo-immunotherapy
We develop a reusable dynamic optimization framework that takes any ordinary differential equation model of tumor–immune–therapy interactions as input, enforces clinically motivated dosing and toxicity constraints, and outputs optimal chemo–ICI regimens.
